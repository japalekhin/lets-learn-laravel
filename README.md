# Let's Learn Laravel

I've been ducking Laravel ever since it appeared on my radar due to a few factors.
* I now prefer Node.js apps on the server.
* Game development has been my focus lately.
* PHP *seems* to be dying.
* And even if I use PHP, I'll go with WordPress because of this simple little reason called **10+ years of experience**.

It's time to change all that!

Laravel seems to be all the rage when it comes to PHP web application development given that you don't want just a blog and a CMS, which in that case: WordPress (bias!).

## Learning

I'm just blindly following along the tutorial below. Absorbing as much as much concept as I can before taking the training wheels off and building a project on my own.
